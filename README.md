This project will document a self-hosted environment running on an **Odroid M1** board and is supposed to be self contained.

It is meant to maximise the homeops (lul) enviroment and just run on this single board, with as many apps and services as possible.

The project will only use **free** and/or **open source** software, the enterprise stuff will run in the homelab-environment.

# Overview

## Plan

There have been many steps in this project, and it has been hosted on different hardware, running different stacks of software since 2022?

The primary design principles were set to the following, after much deliberation;

- **kiss** (because I always overcomplicate everything)
- **self-hosted within reason** (take the hardware as far as it goes, reach out to cloud when there is a determined need)
- **privacy first** (software should honor privacy, encrypt everything))
- **cloud-agnostic** (cheapest and best is the way to go)
- **secure** (authentication, zero-trust, encryption, logging, backup etc)
- **light** (4 arm-cores and 4GB RAM is not a lot.)
- **container-first** (for deployability, transferability etc.)
- **accessible** (usability wherever I'm at)
- **monitored** (monitoring, alerting, tracking, the good stuff)

These are the tools we are going to run :
